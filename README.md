# Tauri Plugin SSE

Server-Sent Events (SSE) is a web technology that allows a server to push real-time updates to a client over a long-lived HTTP connection.

It provides a lightweight, one-way communication channel, making it ideal for applications that need continuous data streaming from the backend without using WebSockets.

SSE is a simple solution for notifications, activity feeds, live status updates, or any scenario where the server needs to send real-time updates to the client.
